I've been building a list of people I want talk to. The list includes business owners, economists, fintech founders/employees, consultants, and VCs. I add someone to this list if I feel a) they have background/experience that is related to what I'm working on b) I believe they have a specific insight/perspective that would be valuable to me c) I think they will give me useful feedback on my business/pitch. Admittedly these are all pretty selfish reasons - I hope that at some point in the future I can pay it forward

I started conducting cold outreach to some of the people on my list via Twitter, LinkedIn, email. I got a lot of responses and I had a handful of really great conversations.

I was initially bummed when some people didn't get back to me, but after some reflection I realized this was a potentially harmful reaction. Some people don't have the time to respond, some have conflicting priorities, and some simply don't care enough to answer - and that's all fine. Remember though, that some people want to help. They want to share their experience, they want to hear what you're working on, they want to help you. If you step away from the plate at the first sign of denial, you'll probably never find those that want to help.
