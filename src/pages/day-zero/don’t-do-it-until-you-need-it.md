When I was first setting up the web app for Securable, I faced some reversible and irreversible decisions (some weren’t exactly irreversible, but would have cost me a lot of time to reverse). When it came to some of the reversible decisions, I let my innate curiosity take hold and I was down the rabbit hole trying to determine if I needed to make a decision on something I didn’t know enough about.

In one instance I chose to integrate a package that didn’t solve a problem I was facing, but I thought it would be nice to have. I spent the past few days trying to launch a new feature and faced a ton of issues due to this “nice to have” package I installed. I spent the next few days removing the package, retracing my steps, and rewriting a ton of code. When facing some reverisble decisions, it may be best to make that decision when you absolutely have to, not when you feel like you should.
