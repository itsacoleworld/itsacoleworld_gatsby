This week the FTC published a release detailing an administrative settlement with my previous employer LendEDU. I was named as an individual respondent in the settlement.

I spent the first four years of my post-grad career helping build the company. I was hired as the first employee, working in a sales role and turned down a full-time role at a big four to work there (I don't think I would have lasted long at a big four consulting firm). I went out to Mountain View, CA for four months with the company to participate in YC during the winter of 2015/2016. The first two years at the company were some of the most transformative periods of my life, but as the business matured we faced some growing pains. Scrappiness was a core tenant that proved troublesome to scale, especially in financial services.

I'm embarrassed to talk about the current situation because the accusations are so distant from the kind of person I know I am. The desire to help others resides at my core and my next chapter will better reflect that.
