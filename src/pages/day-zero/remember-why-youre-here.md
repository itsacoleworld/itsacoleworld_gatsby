Your previous job didn’t provide an ideal work culture, but that’s not why you’re here. You didn’t love the business model or your role, but that’s not why you’re here.

You’re here because you realized that you shouldn’t waste another second doing something you don’t absolutely love. You’re here because you’re going to build a product that maximizes for net positive impact. You’re here because you want to to test your assumptions about your own abilities. It’s going to be hard, you’re going to face resistance and ambiguity, but remember why you chose the road you’re on. Be confident about your decision.
