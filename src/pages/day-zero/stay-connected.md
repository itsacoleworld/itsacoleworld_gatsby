Make an effort to connect with new peers and stay connected with old. You may feel non-productive by spending 2 hours getting coffee with an old colleague, but the time spent will pay dividends. If you do schedule time to meet with someone, be early and be present. Be genuinely interested in the other person - don’t be occupied by your to do list. Time spent away from your project can lead to better focused work and you’d be surprised what insights you draw from an unrelated conversation over coffee.
