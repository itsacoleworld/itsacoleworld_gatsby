I’ve had a hard time getting sleep over the past two weeks. I go to bed, my mind is racing and my legs are restless.  I frequently pick up the phone at 2 or 3am to research something I’ve been tossing around in my head.

I’ve been working late into the night on Securable and I think the new WFH routine has me feeling plugged in 24/7. I also believe the pandemic is contributing some additional subconscious anxiety.

I feel consumed by Securable at the moment. Which I think is mostly a positive, but I need to be more aware of the trade offs. I’ve been trying to stop work at 7pm sharp and going for a walk, listening to music, or a podcast.
