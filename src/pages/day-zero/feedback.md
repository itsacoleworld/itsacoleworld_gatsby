When you’re asking for feedback, remember that feedback is to be interpreted in your own scope. Don’t let tough questions or challenges derail your inspiration. Use them as fuel. Use them to open your perspective. Use them to question your assumptions, but don’t treat advice as binary data (follow or not follow).
