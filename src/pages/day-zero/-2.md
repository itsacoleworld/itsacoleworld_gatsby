Don’t get bogged down worrying about what you think others think you should be doing. Just worry about what you think you should be doing. Don’t dance around your intentions, be deliberate. When you tell people what you’re doing, work on your elevator pitch. Don’t get worried that they won’t understand what you’re doing or why, 99% of them won’t and they won’t care either.
