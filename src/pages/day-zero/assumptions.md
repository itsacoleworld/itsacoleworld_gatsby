I just finished reading “How will you measure your life” by Clayton Christensen. In the book he talks about the failure of Iridium Communications. The satellite phone company failed to address major assumptions and did not think thoroughly about the “job” consumers were hiring their satellite phones to do.

I’m not imposing that making assumptions while building a startup is a bad thing, most startups are in a sense an assumption of how the world could work. However, I tuning it is important to keep those assumptions in check.

I am aware that the success of Securable is predicated on some major assumptions and I feel it may be useful to list them along with the job I feel consumers will want to hire Securable for.

\
Assumptions:
* People will feel comfortable shipping a valuable to me through the mail
* People can/are willing to wait 48+ hours to receive funds
* People value a soft quote and a potentially higher appraisal over convenience of going to a pawn shop
* People who use pawn shops want to build credit


Why would someone hire Securable?
Someone who needs funds to pay their monthly utilities, but do not have a credit card, may hire Securbale for short term financing.
