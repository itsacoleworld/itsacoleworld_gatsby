The past few days I have felt a severe sense of panic regarding COVID-19. Up until this week, I was less concerned about the virus than I should have been. I've been using Twitter exclusively as my news source. There were certainly some early whistle-blowers that I followed, but I feel that the consensus has sharply moved toward social distancing, quarantine, and curve-flattening over the past week. I've seen a lot of folks who previously were part of the "it's just the flu" camp come out and admit that they were very wrong. For me, it was seeing the data coming out of Italy, France, and Spain that was the most concerning.

I have spent the past few days convincing my girlfriend, Allison, that we should leave Hoboken. I think I may have caught her off-guard with how quickly and intensely I came to this conclusion. She was on the fence until tonight when Hoboken closed all bars and restaurants and implemented a curfew. Luckily both of us are in the position to work remotely and there is no real reason for us to stay in the area.

Building a business in this environment will be difficult, but it was never going to be easy. In some ways, I'm fortunate to be starting now. I can only imagine what it is like operating an established business right now. I feel for those business owners who are forced to make extremely difficult decisions right now.
