I decided to launch a pawn shop directory before I launched an appraisal tool or any other product. Why? Because I believe distribution is more important than product, especially at this stage in the company. There are 200k people who are searching for pawn shops near them each month. That is 200k people I can potentially engage with and learn from. I’m collecting market research via providing a valuable resource.

Based on the feedback I’ve received, I have an idea of what I think a potential solution looks like. But by building a distribution channel first, I can now test those assumptions and iterate on a solution faster.
