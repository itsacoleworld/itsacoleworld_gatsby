Skilled trade jobs offer an alternative career path to those who do not want to or can't afford a four-year, post-secondary education. I believe skilled trade jobs are great because:

* They don't require an expensive, four-year degree
* They are essential jobs
* They pay well
* They cannot be outsourced
* They offer great opportunities for entrepreneurship
