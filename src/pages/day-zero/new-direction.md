I spent the past few months building a prototype for [Securable](https://securable.co/). The goal of Securable was to create an affordable, online alternative to a pawn loan. I had spent March-May with my head down, focused on building. I can't say COVID significantly impacted the business - I had built nothing more than a pawn shop directory - but it pushed me to pick my head up sooner than I otherwise would have and reassess what I was working on and why.

I came to the conclusion that building a low-cost, short-term loan could help those without substantial savings afford rent, utilities, a large purchase, etc. But it would merely put a bandaid on a larger problem, socio-economic mobility. There were limited opportunities for individuals in the U.S. to increase their earning potential, without a significant upfront investment.

A college education became the de-facto option for High School graduates and parents. The gatekeeper to a well-paying, impactful career has become a four-year, liberal arts, post-secondary education. Anything less would be seen as a failure. You didn't have the mental ability. You didn't have the drive. You didn't have what it takes. What a toll this takes on a high school student.

After speaking with a family friend who owned a local HVAC company, I learned about the large, and growing, U.S. skills gap. Millions of jobs sit vacant in the U.S. that do not require a bachelors degree. These are well-paying jobs - while I'm skeptical of the abundance of millionaire plumbers - I believe that the salaries would be life changing for a large percentage of Americans.

I believe we are entering a significant inflection point:

* College is expensive, leaving many to analyze whether the cost outweighs the benefits
* COVID has expedited the adoption of remote-learning. With the amount of free information available on the internet, is $50K for zoom classes worth it?
* COVID has forced many to rethink their career prospects

I am building Infra School to make it easier and cheaper to start a career in the skilled trades. Infra School is a career accelerator that combines remote learning with on-the-job experience. The ultimate goal is to take someone with zero knowledge of a specific trade to a full-time job in 6-9 months.

I want to help people achieve their potential. I believe the current system is under-optimized for a large percentage of people. I want people to know that there is no "right" path.
