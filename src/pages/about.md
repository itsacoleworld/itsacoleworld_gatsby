My name is Alex Coleman. I'm 26 and I live in Hoboken, NJ. I'm currently developing the future of skilled trades in the US. I previously led product and business development at LendEDU (YC W15).

I'm passionate about music - mostly 70s rock, classical, current rock/alternative, and 90's underground rap. I enjoy reading books/essays on U.S. history (WWI), Ancient Roman and Greek history, neuroscience, business, science/engineering, and sci-fi.

I didn't study computer science in college, but I've been teaching myself how to program for the past two years.
